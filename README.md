# pecman-demo
PECMAN is a Python library for the simulation of
energy-, time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectra.

This demo contains the core implementation for the simulation of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).

For generating test data: run ``` python generate_data.py```
For viewing the 3D stack, compile the C++ code using ``` scons``` and run ```./viewer```

Controls:  
+ use left mouse button to rotate the data
+ use CTRL + mouse wheel to zoom in/out
+ use ALT + mouse wheel to adjust isolevel
